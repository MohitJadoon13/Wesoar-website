                        <p class="fw-bold" data-i18n="exhibitBSecurityMeasuresTitle">Technical and Organisational Security Measures</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBSecurityMeasuresIntro">The following descriptions provide an overview of the technical and organisational security measures implemented. It should be noted however that, in some circumstances, in order to protect the integrity of the security measures and in the context of data security, detailed descriptions may not be available, however additional information regarding technical and organisational measures may be found in the Information Security Policy. It is acknowledged and agreed that the Information Security Policy and the technical and organisational measures described therein will be updated and amended from time to time, at the sole discretion of the Processor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the technical and organisational measures will not fall short of those measures described in the Information Security Policy in any material, detrimental way.</p>

                        <p class="fw-bold mt-3" data-i18n="exhibitBEntranceControlTitle">Entrance Control</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBEntranceControlText">Personal Data is kept on servers hosted in data centres that adhere to strict and independently verified standards of physical access control which include ISO27001 as a minimum.</p>

                        <p class="fw-bold mt-3" data-i18n="exhibitBSystemAccessControlTitle">System Access Control</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBSystemAccessControlText">Remote access by WeSoar employees to the data processing systems is only possible after successful authentication and authorisation by a centralised directory service. All access attempts, successful and unsuccessful are logged and monitored. Access to End User's WeSoar account is authenticated by successfully entering an email address or user name or registered mobile phone number and password of the user's choice, or via one of the Single Sign On options available such as SAML2.0, or Login with Google, Microsoft or Slack.

                        Additional technical protections are in place using firewalls and proxy servers and state of the art encryption technology that is applied where appropriate to meet the protective purpose based on risk.</p>

                        <p class="fw-bold mt-3" data-i18n="exhibitBDataAccessControlTitle">Data Access Control</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBDataAccessControlIntro">Technical and organisational measures regarding the on-demand structure of the authorisation concept, data access rights and monitoring and recording of the same:</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBDataAccessControlText1">Measures regarding data access control are targeted on the basis that only such data can be accessed for which an access authorisation exists and that data cannot be read, copied, changed or deleted in an unauthorised manner during the processing and after the saving of such data.</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBDataAccessControlText2">Access to data necessary for the performance of the particular task is ensured within the systems and applications by a corresponding role and authorisation concept. In accordance to the "least privilege" and "need-to-know" principles, each role has only those rights which are necessary for the fulfilment of the task to be performed by the individual person.</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBDataAccessControlText3">To maintain data access control, state of the art encryption technology is applied to the Personal Data itself where deemed appropriate to protect sensitive data based on risk.</p>

                        <p class="fw-bold mt-3" data-i18n="exhibitBTransmissionControlTitle">Transmission Control</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBTransmissionControlIntro">Technical and organisational measures regarding the transport, transfer, transmission, storage and subsequent review of Personal Data on data media (manually or electronically):</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBTransmissionControlText1">Transmission control is implemented so that Personal Data cannot be read, copied, changed or deleted without authorisation, during transfer or while stored on data media, and so that it can be monitored and determined as to which recipients a transfer of Personal Data is intended.</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBTransmissionControlText2">The measures necessary to ensure data security during transport, transfer and transmission of Personal Data as well as any other company or Customer Data are detailed in the Information Security Policy. This standard includes a description of the protection required during the processing of data, from the creation of such data to deletion, including the protection of such data in accordance with the data classification level.</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBTransmissionControlText3">For the purpose of transfer control, an encryption technology is used (e.g. remote access to the company network via two factor VPN tunnel and full disk encryption). The suitability of an encryption technology is measured against the protective purpose.

                        The transfer of Personal Data to a third party (e.g. customers, sub-contractors, service providers) is only made if a corresponding contract exists, and only for the specific purposes. If Personal Data is transferred to companies located outside the EEA, the Processor provides that an adequate level of data protection exists at the target location or organisation in accordance with the European Union's data protection requirements, e.g. by employing contracts based on the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>

                        <p class="fw-bold mt-3" data-i18n="exhibitBDataEntryControlTitle">Data Entry Control</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBDataEntryControlIntro">Technical and organisational measures regarding recording and monitoring of the circumstances of data entry to enable retroactive review:</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBDataEntryControlText">System inputs are recorded in the form of log files therefore it is possible to review retroactively whether and by whom Personal Data was entered, altered or deleted.</p>

                        <p class="fw-bold mt-3" data-i18n="exhibitBDataProcessingControlTitle">Data Processing Control</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBDataProcessingControlIntro">Technical and organisational measures to differentiate between the competences of principal and contractor:</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBDataProcessingControlText">The aim of the data processing control is to provide that Personal Data is processed by a commissioned data processor in accordance with the Instructions of the principal.

                        Details regarding data processing control are set forth in the Agreement and DPA.</p>

                        <p class="fw-bold mt-3" data-i18n="exhibitBAvailabilityControlTitle">Availability Control</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBAvailabilityControlIntro">Technical and organisational measures regarding data backup (physical/logical):</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBAvailabilityControlText1">Data is stored in triplicate in near real time. Transaction logs backups are taken every 5-10 minutes. Differential backups are taken every few hours, and full backups are taken weekly. The backup retention period is 35 days. All backups are encrypted.</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBAvailabilityControlText2">If Personal Data is no longer required for the purposes for which it was processed, it is deleted promptly. It should be noted that with each deletion, the Personal Data is only locked in the first instance and is then deleted for good with a certain delay. This is done in order to prevent accidental deletions or possible intentional damage.</p>

                        <p class="fw-bold mt-3" data-i18n="exhibitBSeparationControlTitle">Separation Control</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBSeparationControlIntro">Technical and organisational measures regarding purposes of collection and separated processing:</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBSeparationControlText1">Personal Data used for internal purposes only e.g. as part of the respective customer relationship, may be transferred to a third party such as a subcontractor, solely under consideration of contractual arrangements and appropriate data protection regulatory requirements.</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBSeparationControlText2">Employees are instructed to collect, process and use Personal Data only within the framework and for the purposes of their duties (e.g. service provision). At a technical level, multi-client capability includes separation of functions as well as appropriate separation of testing and production systems.</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBSeparationControlText3">Customer Data is stored in a way that logically separates it from other customer data.</p>
                        <p data-i18n="exhibitBSeparationControlText4">Customer data is encrypted at rest using AES256 bit encryption and data in transit is protected by Transport Layer Security ("TLS").</p>
